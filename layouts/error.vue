        <p>There has been an error. It is most likely that you have encountered this error because someone put a bad link on their website or maybe you typed the wrong URL in to the address bar. Maybe the link that got you here was to an old version of my site.</p>
        <p>That is okay. You may be wondering what to do next though. I probably would be.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>You could <a href="/" title="A link through which the home page of this site may be found. [parps horns]" class="textlink">go to the home page</a>.</li>
          <li>Maybe the thing you were looking for doesn&rsquo;t exist on the site and you want to ask me about it. An email is probably the thing here. My email address is: <a href="mailto:dan&#64;hammerheadrabbits.com" title="This is  my email."  class="textlink">dan&#64;hammerheadrabbits.com</a></li>
          <li>You could mooch around some other part of the site using the navigation which can be found clicking on the question mark in the thought bubble.</li>
          <li>Alternatively, you could just click on one of these links:
            <ul>
              <li><a href="/development" class="textlink" title="Some websites I have built">Development</a></li>
              <li><a href="/Art" class="textlink" title="I make art">Art</a></li>
              <li><a href="/Photography" class="textlink" title="I often look at the world through a camera lens">Photography</a></li>
              <li><a href="/about" class="textlink" title="Websites always have an About Me section right?">About me</a></li>
            </ul>
          </li>
